# (Another) THL-bookmarklet

This bookmarklet implementation is largely based on the implemention from Daniel M. Gattermann which can be found here: http://cinnamonthoughts.org/2011/06/10/the-hit-list-bookmarklet-for-mac-and-ios/

The above version stopped working in modern browsers for many sites because of an uncaught *SecurityException*. The version below fixes this issue.

# How to install the bookmarklet
- Open [this link](bookmarklet.html)
- Save the raw version of *bookmarklet.html* 
- Open *bookmarklet.html* in your browser
- Drag the link into your bookmarks
- Done!

Testet in Firefox and Chrome on OS X.
